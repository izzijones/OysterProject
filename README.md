# Oyster Project
** When code is first downloaded and opened in IntelliJ, in the TravelTrackerTest.java class you must option + enter on the OysterCardChargeModel import at the top of the file and create a dependency. For some reason this does not save on its own. 

This project contains a gradle build and can be imported with Gradle.

I, Isabella Jones, worked with Hayley Pearson on this project.
